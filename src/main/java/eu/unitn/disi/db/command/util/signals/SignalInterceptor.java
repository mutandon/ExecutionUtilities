/**
 * <p>
 * A simple wrapper around the undocumented and unsupported
 * <code>sun.misc.Signal*</code> classes which are present in most JVM
 * implementations. It can be used to trap OS signals such as SIGINT, SIGTERM,
 * and SIGHUP on these JVMs.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * <code>SignalInterceptor</code> provides a level of indirection
 * between your code and <code>sun.misc.SignalHandler</code> which can
 * be useful for the following reasons:
 * </p>
 * 
 * <ol>
 * <li>It gracefully handles the situation when the
 * <code>sun.misc.Signal*</code> classes are not available, throwing a checked
 * exception out of the <code>register</code> method, rather than awkward
 * <code>LinkageErrors</code> durring class initialization.</li>
 * <li>It has a simple technique for chaining signal handlers.</li>
 * <li>It is documented and has gone through some testing.</li>
 * </ol>
 * 
 * <p>
 * Some possible uses of this class are:
 * </p>
 * <ul>
 * <li>Change the behavior of SIGHUP so that instead of exiting the JVM, your
 * application reloads its configuration file.</li>
 * <li>Log the fatal signals SIGHUP, SIGINT, and SIGTERM before passing them 
 * onto the JVM's native handlers, so that you have a record of when and why 
 * your application exited.</li>
 * <li>Implement your own version of ShutdownHooks which run prior to the
 * standard ones. This can be useful because many other packages have their own
 * ShutdownHooks which close resources which you might like to use. For example
 * the <code>java.util.logging</code> package closes all of its files in its
 * ShutdownHook, which means your ShutdownHook might not be able to log
 * anything. Note that you would still need to deal with
 * <code>System.exit()</code>, but there is a different hack available for
 * that <code>;)</code>.</li>
 * </ul>
